# Budget Challenge

## Backstory
Your instructor, Jon, has a tough time with managing his money. He's been told to create a budget in Excel, but the thought of using spreadsheets makes him very unhappy. He's tasked you with creating a terminal based budgeting application so that he can keep track of his expenses.

Please note that we are going to expound on this project later in the course when we get to databases, Sinatra, and Rails.

### What skills does this solidify?
* Reading/writing to CSV
* Single responsibility classes / small methods
* Having Ruby objects talk to one another
* TDD / RSPEC

### Release 0
Think through the classes you'll need to write this app. This is an open-ended challenge, but some possibilities may include: budget, transaction, budget category, etc.

### Release 1
Your favorite: **TDD**. Work with your pair to figure out what a user can do through the command line. How will they enter new transactions? How will someone's budget be saved? How will transactions be saved? How will transactions be categorized and saved so that they know how much is left in a particular category? How will a user exit the program?

For the purposes of our challenge, do not have user authentication. Figure that a user is only going to have this budgeting program on their computer.

### Release 2
Code. _Red, Green, Refactor!_

Now that you've written tests, you have a general idea of the direction you want to go.
